## Overview

Titano-SR1 is a sophisticated character-level language model designed for generating classical literature-style text, with a particular focus on Shakespearean content. The system incorporates advanced features including self-reflection, agency, and philosophical awareness.

## Core Components

### 1. Memory System
- Persistent storage of experiences and reflections
- SQL database backend for storing:
  - Training memories
  - Philosophical reflections
  - Historical performance data

### 2. Agency System
- Goal-oriented decision making
- Dynamic training strategy selection
- Prioritized objectives:
  1. Loss minimization
  2. Accuracy improvement
  3. Overfitting prevention
  4. Training efficiency
  5. Generation stability

### 3. Reflection System
- Performance analysis
- Self-awareness mechanisms
- Training history logging
- Action documentation

## Model Architecture

```
Sequential Neural Network:
1. Embedding Layer (100 dim)
2. LayerNormalization
3. LSTM (256 units) + Dropout (0.2)
4. LSTM (256 units) + Dropout (0.2)
5. LSTM (256 units) + Dropout (0.2)
6. Dense (512 units) + ReLU
7. LayerNormalization + Dropout
8. Dense (Output) + Softmax
```

## Training Process

### Data Preparation
1. Download Shakespeare dataset
2. Clean and validate text
3. Create character mappings
4. Generate sequences with stride

### Training Configuration
- Batch Size: 128
- Initial Learning Rate: 1e-4
- Epochs: 20 (with early stopping)
- Validation Split: 0.1

### Optimization
- AdamW optimizer
- Weight decay: 0.01
- Beta1: 0.9, Beta2: 0.999
- Learning rate reduction on plateau

### Callbacks
1. EarlyStopping (patience=5)
2. ModelCheckpoint (save best)
3. ReduceLROnPlateau
4. TensorBoard logging

## Usage

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks:
- Loss (training and validation)
- Accuracy (training and validation)
- Perplexity
- Top-5 accuracy
- Generation quality metrics

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- SQLite3

## Model Persistence

Models are saved in two formats:
1. `.h5` format (complete model)
2. `.keras` format (best weights)

Character mappings are saved in `char_mappings.json`.
